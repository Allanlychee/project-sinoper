Description/Concept
Users can enter location, mileage range, and date range information to view upcoming Eventbrite events in their chosen area. The map markers can be clicked to display a pop-up containing event information, which can then be added to an Events Queue area below the map to display additional details.

Motivation
The Eventbrite website does not include the ability to visualize multiple events on one map. This also allows a user to, in essence, save multiple events in which they may be interested without creating an Eventbrite account.
